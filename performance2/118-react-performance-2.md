# React performance optimization

- use `shouldComponentUpdate` or extend `PureComponent` to reduce re-renders
- use [Why did you render](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@welldone-software/why-did-you-render) to check why a component is re-rendered
- use [tree shaking](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-javascript/tree-shaking/)
