# Progressive web app

use the chrome extension 'lighthouse' to check PWA score

three keys are HTTPS, app manifest, and service worker

## HTTPS

PWA requires it (use [Let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/))

## App manifest

- add a manifest.json file
- this file describes how it should behave when installed on the user's desktop or mobile device
- add favicon and splash screen [Favicon generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)

## Service worker

service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background separate from the web page web app. It is generally used for features that don't need a web page or user interaction.

the main feature is that is allows for offline experiences.

create-react-app generates the service worker for you

how service worker works in PWA

1. register a service worker
1. once a service worker is activated and registered. it's going to be in one of two states.

   - it's either going to be terminated to save memory or
   - it's going to be running in the background to fetch messages and events that occurs in the network request.

1. every network request will go to service worker first
1. service worker will check if the requested file is in the cache api (a browser web api)
   - if yes, it'll serve this
   - if not, it'll send the request to backend
1. once the file arrives, it'll be cached in the cache api
