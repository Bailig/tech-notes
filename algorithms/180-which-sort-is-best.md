# When to Use Which Sort?

- insertion sort
  - when input is small
  - items are mostly sorted
  - easy to implement
- merge sort
  - guaranteed O(n log n)
  - O(n) space complexity
- quiz sort
  - more memory efficient than merge sort O(log n)
  - worst case time complexity O(n^2)
  - use it when not worry about the worst case
