# Searching

- linear search
- binary search
- breadth first search
- depth first search

## Linear Search

a linear search or sequential search sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

## Binary Search

binary search

- finds the position of a target value within a sorted array
- compares the target value to the middle element of the array

## Breadth First Search

breadth-first search starts at the tree root, and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

- searches level by level

- pros
  - short path
  - closer nodes
- cons
  - need memory to store the nodes

## Depth First Search

depth-first search starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

- search branch by branch

- pros
  - less memory
- cons
  - can get slow when path is deep
