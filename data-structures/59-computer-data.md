# How Computer Store Data

## RAM

- think of RAM as an storage area with numbered shelves. these numbers are called addresses.
- each of these shelves holds eight bits or numbers.
- a bit is a tiny electrical switch that can be turned on or off but instead of calling it on or off we call it 1 or 0.
- 8 bits is called a byte. each shelf has one byte of storage.
- the CPU is connected to something called a memory controller. a memory controller does the actual reading and writing of memory.
- the memory controller has connections individually to all of these shelves. it means that we can access any shelf directly. that's what the name random access memory means.

example

variable 1.

- is integer in 32 bits (can be 64 bits).
- is a block size of RAM.

```javascript
Math.pow(6, 1000); // Infinity
// this number is too big to store
```
