# Stacks vs Queues

## Stacks

stacks can be implemented using array or linked list

using array

- pros
  - fast access because data are stored next to each other
- cons
  - when the item limit is reached, could double up the memory

using linked list

- pros
  - has more dynamic memory
- cons
  - extra memory is being used for storing the 'next' pointers

## Queues

queues should be implemented with linked list because unshift on array is O(n)
