- one root value
- subtrees of children with one parent node
- represented as a set of linked nodes

## Binary Tree

a binary tree each node has at most two children. they are referred to as the left child and the right child.

### Perfect Binary Tree

A perfect binary tree is a binary tree in which

- all interior nodes have two children
- all leaves have the same depth or same level

two main properties

- the number of nodes on each level doubles previous level's
- the number of nodes on a level equals the sum of all the nodes above plus one
