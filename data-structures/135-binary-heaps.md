# Binary Heap

Binary heap is

- a binary tree
- every child belongs to a parent node that has a greater priority or value.
- when the root node is the largest, it's called max heap
- when the root node is the smallest, it's called min heap
- good for comparative operations

time complexity

- lookup O(n)
- insert O(log N)
- delete O(log N)
