# Binary Search Tree

a binary search tree is a rooted binary tree whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the node's left subtree and less than those in its right subtree.

- lookup O(log N)
- inset O(log N)
- delete O(log N)

pros

- better than O(n)
- ordered
- flexible size

cons

- no O(1) operation

## Balanced Binary Search Tree

- lookup O(log N)
- inset O(log N)
- delete O(log N)

## Unbalanced Binary Search Tree

unbalanced search tree is like a linked list

- lookup O(n)
- inset O(n)
- delete O(n)
