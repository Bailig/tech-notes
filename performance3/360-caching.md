# Caching

caching is the process of storing some data in cash.

cash is a temporary storage component area where the data is stored so that in future data can be served faster.

## CPU, RAM, and hard disk

**CPUs** are built with a special on chip memory called registers.

registers usually consists of a small amount of fast storage.

- closest
- smallest
- fastest

**random access memory (RAM)** are

- closer to the CPU not as close as the registers
- larger than registers
  - enough to hold significant information
- because this is in memory, as soon as the power goes off, the information is gone
- because it is a memory, it's fast to access.

**hard disk drive** is

- cheap
- slow
- if the power goes off this disk will remember our information
  - able to store long term data.
