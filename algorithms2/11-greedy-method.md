# Greedy Method

Greedy Method solves optimization problems. Optimization problems are the problems where you're looking for the max or min values.

Greedy Method says if I need to make a decision from all the options, I'll pick the one that logically gets me to the optimal solution. For example, picking the shortest road from given ways.

Greedy Method does not guarantee picking the best path, because the decision is made in the moment at every single step, it does not consider future steps. Dijkstra's algorithm covers this weakness.
