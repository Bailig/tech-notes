# Backtracking

Backtracking solves problems that are

- about returning all the solution
- about returning a valid solution among all.
  - could have more than one solution

Core of backtracking algorism:

- The moment you find out one path is not valid, stop keep going down that path.
  - try one, and if not valid, go back to previous steps and try again differently.
- Backtracking is a brute force solution, compute every possible options, no better algorism.
